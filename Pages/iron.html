        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
  
        <p>In your house, start mining stairs downwards. Each step should have three free spaces above of it. When you get to y layer 16, stop making steps. <span class="bold">Note: </span><span class="italic">Y is the middle coordinate.</span></p>
      </div><!--ends id one-->
      <div id="two">
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
  
        <p>Mine a two wide space at the bottom of the stairs, and continue it to the left for about 20 blocks. When you're done, go back to the stairs and mine with your back to the stairs. Mine for a while, and when you stop, turn left and make a one-wide tunnel way approximately the same length as the two wide one. <span class="bold">Note: </span><span class="italic">If you see any iron, mine it all.</span></p>
      </div><!--ends id two-->
      <div id="three">
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
  
        <p>Go back to the first one wide tunnel, and count two blocks down your other one-wide tunnel. Start mining there, and continue mining until you reach the two wide tunnel. Go two spaces to the left when facing your tunnel, and start a new tunnel. Continue digging tunnels two spaces apart, until you have as much iron as you want. Now you have successfully started an iron mine. Whenever you need iron, just go mining.</p>
